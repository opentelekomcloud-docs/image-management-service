Installing Cloud-Init
=====================

Scenarios
---------

To ensure that you can use the user data injection function to inject initial custom information into ECSs created from a private image (such as setting the ECS login password), install Cloud-Init on the ECS used to create the image.

-  You need to download Cloud-Init from its official website. Therefore, you must bind an EIP to the ECS.
-  If Cloud-Init is not installed, you cannot configure an ECS. As a result, you can only use the password in the image file to log in to the created ECSs.
-  By default, ECSs created from a public image have Cloud-Init installed. You do not need to install or configure Cloud-Init on such ECSs.
-  For ECSs created using an external image file, install and configure Cloud-Init by performing the operations in this section. For how to configure Cloud-Init, see :ref:`Configuring Cloud-Init <en-us_topic_0122876047>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  An EIP has been bound to the ECS.
-  You have logged in to the ECS.
-  The IP address obtaining mode of the ECS is DHCP.

Procedure
---------

#. Check whether Cloud-Init has been installed.

   For details, see :ref:`Check Whether Cloud-Init Has Been Installed <en-us_topic_0030730603__section57525650153449>`.

#. Install Cloud-Init.

   You can install Cloud-Init using either of the following methods: :ref:`(Recommended) Install Cloud-Init Using the Official Installation Package <en-us_topic_0030730603__section9013470154018>` and :ref:`Install Cloud-Init Using the Official Source Code Package and pip <en-us_topic_0030730603__section124220553610>`.

Check Whether Cloud-Init Has Been Installed
-------------------------------------------

Perform the operations provided here to check whether Cloud-Init has been installed.

The methods of checking whether Cloud-Init is installed vary depending on the OSs. Take CentOS 6 as an example. Run the following command to check whether Cloud-Init is installed:

**rpm -qa \|grep cloud-init**

If information similar to the following is displayed, Cloud-Init has been installed:

.. code-block::

   cloud-init-0.7.5-10.el6.centos.2.x86_64

If Cloud-Init has been installed, perform the following operations:

-  Check whether to use the certificate in the ECS OS. If the certificate is no longer used, delete it.

   -  If the certificate is stored in a directory of user **root**, for example, */$path/$to/$root*\ **/.ssh/authorized_keys**, run the following commands:

      **cd /root/.ssh**

      **rm authorized_keys**

   -  If the certificate is not stored in a directory of user **root**, for example, */$path/$to/$none-root*\ **/.ssh/authorized_keys**, run the following commands:

      **cd /home/centos/.ssh**

      **rm authorized_keys**

-  Run the following command to delete the cache generated by Cloud-Init and ensure that the ECS created from the private image can be logged in by using the certificate:

   **sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cloud/\***

.. note::

   Do not restart the ECS after performing the configuration. Otherwise, you need to configure it again.

(Recommended) Install Cloud-Init Using the Official Installation Package
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The method of installing Cloud-Init on an ECS varies depending on the OS. Perform the installation operations as user **root**.

The following describes how to install Cloud-Init on an ECS running SUSE Linux, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu. For other OS types, install the required type of Cloud-Init. For example, you need to install coreos-cloudinit on ECSs running CoreOS.

-  SUSE Linux

   Paths for obtaining the Cloud-Init installation package for SUSE Linux

   `http://ftp5.gwdg.de/pub/opensuse/repositories/Cloud:/Tools/ <http://ftp5.gwdg.de/pub/opensuse/repositories/Cloud:/Tools>`__

   http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Cloud:/Tools/

   .. note::

      Select the required repo installation package in the provided paths.

   Take SUSE Enterprise Linux Server 12 as an example. Perform the following steps to install Cloud-Init:

   #. Log in to the ECS used to create a Linux private image.

   #. Run the following command to install the network installation source for SUSE Enterprise Linux Server 12:

      **zypper ar http://ftp5.gwdg.de/pub/opensuse/repositories/Cloud:/Tools/SLE_12_SP3/Cloud:Tools.repo**

   #. Run the following command to update the network installation source:

      **zypper refresh**

   #. Run the following command to install Cloud-Init:

      **zypper install cloud-init**

   #. Run the following commands to enable Cloud-Init to automatically start upon system boot:

      -  SUSE 11

         **chkconfig cloud-init-local on; chkconfig cloud-init on; chkconfig cloud-config on; chkconfig cloud-final on**

         **service cloud-init-local status; service cloud-init status; service cloud-config status; service cloud-final status**

      -  SUSE 12 and openSUSE 12/13/42

         **systemctl enable cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

         **systemctl status cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

      .. caution::

         For SUSE and openSUSE, perform the following steps to disable dynamic change of the ECS name:

         a. Run the following command to open the **dhcp** file using the vi editor:

            **vi** **etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp**

         b. Change the value of **DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME** in the **dhcp** file to **no**.

-  **CentOS**

   :ref:`Table 1 <en-us_topic_0030730603__table859383892814>` lists the Cloud-Init installation paths for CentOS. Select the required installation package from the following addresses.

Install Cloud-Init Using the Official Source Code Package and pip
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The following operations use Cloud-Init 0.7.9 as an example to describe how to install Cloud-Init.

#. Download the **cloud-init-0.7.9.tar.gz** source code package (version 0.7.9 is recommended) and upload it to the **/home/** directory of the ECS.

   Download **cloud-init-0.7.9.tar.gz** from the following path:

   https://launchpad.net/cloud-init/trunk/0.7.9/+download/cloud-init-0.7.9.tar.gz

#. Create a **pip.conf** file in the **~/.pip/** directory and edit the following content:

   .. note::

      If the **~/.pip/** directory does not exist, run the **mkdir ~/.pip** command to create it.

   .. code-block::

      [global]
      index-url  = https://<$mirror>/simple/
      trusted-host = <$mirror>

   .. note::

      Replace *<$mirror>* with a public network PyPI source.

      Public network PyPI source: https://pypi.python.org/

#. Run the following command to install the downloaded Cloud-Init source code package (select **--upgrade** as needed during installation):

   **pip install [--upgrade] /home/cloud-init-0.7.9.tar.gz**

#. Run the **cloud-init -v** command. Cloud-Init is installed successfully if the following information is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      cloud-init 0.7.9

#. Enable Cloud-Init to automatically start upon system boot.

   -  If the OS uses SysVinit to manage automatic start of services, run the following commands:

      **chkconfig --add cloud-init-local; chkconfig --add cloud-init; chkconfig --add cloud-config; chkconfig --add cloud-final**

      **chkconfig cloud-init-local on; chkconfig cloud-init on; chkconfig cloud-config on; chkconfig cloud-final on**

      **service cloud-init-local status; service cloud-init status; service cloud-config status; service cloud-final status**

   -  If the OS uses Systemd to manage automatic start of services, run the following commands:

      **systemctl enable cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

      **systemctl status cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

.. caution::

   If you install Cloud-Init using the official source code package and pip, pay attention to the following:

   #. Add user **syslog** to the **adm** group during the installation. If user **syslog** exists, add it to the **adm** group. For some OSs (such as CentOS and SUSE), user **syslog** may not exist. Run the following commands to create user **syslog** and add it to the **adm** group:

      **useradd syslog**

      **groupadd adm**

      **usermod -g adm syslog**

   #. Change the value of **distro** in **system_info** in the **/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg** file based on the OS release version, such as **distro: ubuntu**, **distro: sles**, **distro: debian**, and **distro: fedora**.
