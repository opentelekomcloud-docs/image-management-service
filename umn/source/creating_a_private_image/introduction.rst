Introduction
============

A private image is an image available only to the user who created it. It contains an OS, preinstalled public applications, and a user's personal applications. A private image can be a system disk image, data disk image, or full-ECS image. It can be created from a cloud server or an external image file.

Creating a private image does not affect the running of services on the cloud server or cause data loss.

This section describes how to create a private image using any of the following methods:

After a system disk image is created, you can use it to create an ECS or change the OS of an ECS.
