How Do I Select an OS?
======================

-  Linux

   Used for development platforms or services that run Linux. CentOS and Ubuntu are provided. CentOS is recommended.

   The system disk must be no less than 40 GB, and the memory must be no less than 512 MB.

-  OS selection for servers that require memory greater than 4 GB

   Because 32-bit OSs allow addressing only within a 4 GB memory range, if the required memory capacity is 4 GB or larger, select a 64-bit OS.
