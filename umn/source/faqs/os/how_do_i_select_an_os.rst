How Do I Select an OS?
======================

-  Linux

   Used for development platforms or services that run Linux. CentOS and Ubuntu are provided. CentOS is recommended.

   The system disk must be at least 40 GB, and there must be at least 512 MB of memory.

-  If your servers require more than 4 GB of memory, select a 64-bit OS because 4 GB is the maximum memory a 32-bit OS can access.
