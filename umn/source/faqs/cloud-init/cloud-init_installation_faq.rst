Cloud-Init Installation FAQ
===========================

You are advised to install Cloud-Init on the ECS that will be used to create a private image so that new ECSs created from the private image support custom configurations (for example, changing the ECS login password).

For details about how to install Cloud-Init, see :ref:`Installing Cloud-Init <en-us_topic_0030730603>`.

For details about how to configure Cloud-Init, see :ref:`Configuring Cloud-Init <en-us_topic_0122876047>`.

The following describes common problems you may encounter when installing Cloud-Init and their solutions.

Ubuntu 16.04/CentOS 7: Failed to Set Cloud-Init Automatic Start
---------------------------------------------------------------

-  Symptom

   After Cloud-Init is installed, you run the following command to configure Cloud-Init automatic start:

   **systemctl enable cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

      **Figure 1** Failed to enable Cloud-Init to start automatically

-  Solution

   #. Run the following command to roll back the configuration:

      **systemctl unmask cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

   #. Run the following command to configure automatic start again:

      **systemctl enable cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

   #. Run the following command to check the Cloud-Init status:

      **systemctl status cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

      As shown in the following figures, **failed** is displayed and all services are in the **inactive** state.

      This is because the address that the system uses to access Cloud-Init is redirected to **/usr/bin/**, but the actual installation path is **/usr/local/bin**.

   #. Run the following command to copy Cloud-Init to the **usr/bin** directory:

      **cp /usr/local/cloud-init /usr/bin/**

   #. Run the following command to restart Cloud-Init:

      **systemctl restart cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

   #. Run the following command to check the Cloud-Init status:

      **systemctl status cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

Ubuntu 14.04: chkconfig and systemctl Not Installed
---------------------------------------------------

-  Symptom

   chkconfig is not installed.

-  Solution

   Run the following commands to install chkconfig:

   **apt-get update**

   **apt-get install sysv-rc-conf**

   **cp /usr/sbin/sysv-rc-conf /usr/sbin/chkconfig**

   Run the following command to query the Cloud-Init version:

   **cloud-init -v**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      -bash:/usr/bin/cloud-init:not found this command

   Run the following command to copy Cloud-Init to the **usr/bin** directory:

   **cp /usr/local/bin/cloud-init /usr/bin**/

Debian 9.5: Failed to Query the Cloud-Init Version and Configure Automatic Start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#. Run the following command to query the Cloud-Init version:

   **cloud-init -v**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      -bash:/usr/bin/cloud-init:not found this command

   Run the **cp /usr/local/bin/cloud-init /usr/bin/** command to copy Cloud-Init to the **usr/bin** directory.

#. Run the **cloud-init init --local** command.

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

      **Figure 5** Information returned when Cloud-Init automatic start successfully set

   The compilation fails because GCC is not installed.

   To solve this issue:

   Run the following command to install GCC. Then, install Cloud-Init again.

   **yum -y install gcc**

#. After Cloud-Init is installed, run the following command to configure Cloud-Init automatic start:

   **systemctl enable cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

   Information similar to the following is displayed.

   To solve this issue:

   a. Run the following command to roll back the configuration:

      **systemctl unmask cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

   b. Run the following command to set automatic start again:

      **systemctl enable cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

   c. Run the following command to restart Cloud-Init:

      **systemctl restart cloud-init-local.service cloud-init.service cloud-config.service cloud-final.service**

      Run the **systemctl status** command to check the Cloud-Init status. Information similar to the following is displayed:

CentOS 7/Fedora 28: Required C Compiler Not Installed
-----------------------------------------------------

-  Symptom

   After Cloud-Init is successfully installed, you run the following command:

   **cloud-init init --local**

   The following information is displayed:

   .. code-block::

      /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Cheetah/Compiler.py:1532: UserWarning:
      You don't have the C version of NameMapper installed! I'm disabling Cheetah's useStackFrames option as it is painfully slow with the Python version of NameMapper. You should get a copy of Cheetah with the compiled C version of NameMapper.
        "\nYou don't have the C version of NameMapper installed!

-  Cause analysis

   This alarm is generated because C version of NameMapper needs to be compiled when Cloud-Init is installed. However, GCC is not installed in the system, and the compilation cannot be performed. As a result, NameMapper is missing.

-  Solution

   Run the following command to install GCC:

   **yum -y install gcc**

   Reinstall Cloud-Init.

CentOS 7/Fedora: Failed to Use the New Password to Log In to an ECS Created from an Image
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-  Symptom

   You cannot use a new password to log in to an ECS created from an image with Cloud-Init installed. After logging in to the ECS using the old password, you find that NICs of the ECS are not started.


   .. figure:: /_static/images/en-us_image_0137083450.png
      :alt: **Figure 8** NIC not started

      **Figure 8** NIC not started

-  Solution

   Log in to the ECS used to create that image, open the DHCP configuration file **/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth**\ *X*, and comment out **HWADDR**.
