How Do I Configure a Linux Private Image to Make It Automatically Expand Its Root Partition?
============================================================================================

Constraints
-----------

-  An image whose root partition file system is xfs cannot automatically expand its partitions.
-  An image that has the LVM partition cannot automatically expand its partitions.
-  Images whose file system is ext3 or ext4 are recommended.

   .. note::

      After OS partitions of old versions are expanded, the OS must be restarted to update the file system.

Installation of growpart on Different OSs
-----------------------------------------

To enable private images to automatically expand the root partition, install growpart.

.. table:: **Table 1** growpart installation packages for different OSs

   ============= =====================================================
   OS            Tool Package
   ============= =====================================================
   Debian/Ubuntu cloud-init, cloud-utils, and cloud-initramfs-growroot
   Fedora/CentOS cloud-init, cloud-utils, and cloud-utils-growpart
   SUSE/openSUSE cloud-init and growpart
   ============= =====================================================

.. note::

   For Debian 9, use method 1 to install growpart. If the installation fails, use method 2 to install growpart.

   **Method 1**:

   Run the following command to install growpart:

   **apt-get install -y -f cloud-init cloud-utils cloud-initramfs-growroot**

   **Method 2**:

   If method 1 fails, it may be because the installation source of Debian 9.0.0 is faulty. You need to download dependent packages **cloud-utils** and **cloud-initramfs-growroot** and install them.

   #. Run the following command to download the dependent packages:

      **wget** *Package download path*

      You can obtain the dependent packages from the following paths:

      http://ftp.br.debian.org/debian/pool/main/c/cloud-utils/cloud-utils_0.29-1_all.deb

      http://ftp.br.debian.org/debian/pool/main/c/cloud-initramfs-tools/cloud-initramfs-growroot_0.18.debian5_all.deb

   #. Run the following command to rectify the dependent packages:

      **apt --fix-broken install**

   #. Run the following command to install the dependent packages:

      **dpkg -i** *cloud-utils* *package path* *cloud-initramfs-growroot* *package path*

      An example command is **dpkg -i /root/cloud-utils_0.29-1_all.deb /root/cloud-initramfs-growroot_0.18.debian5_all.deb**.

   For other Debian versions, run the following command to install dependent packages:

   **apt-get update;apt-get install cloud-utils cloud-initramfs-growroot**

Procedure
---------

Take the following as two examples of image disk partitioning:

If the root partition is the last partition, see :ref:`Root partition at the last <en-us_topic_0076880304__li38782413161354>`.

If the root partition is not the last partition, see :ref:`Root partition not at the last <en-us_topic_0076880304__li17770807112053>`.

.. note::

   If the **parted** command fails, ensure that the **parted** tool has been installed in the OS. Perform the following operations to install the tool:

   -  For CentOS, run the following command:

      **yum install parted**

   -  For Debian, run the following command:

      **apt-get install parted**

-  .. _en-us_topic_0076880304__li38782413161354:

   Root partition at the last (**/dev/xvda1: swap** and **/dev/xvda2: root**)

   For example, if the system disk size of CentOS 6.5 64bit is 40 GB, perform the following operations to configure a Linux private image so that it can automatically expand its root partition:

   #. Run the following command to query the partitions of **/dev/xvda**:

      **parted -l /dev/xvda**

      As shown in the command output, the root partition is the second partition and is 38.7 GB.

   #. Install growpart to ensure that the image can automatically expand its root partition.

      Run the following command to install growpart:

      **yum install cloud-\***

      .. note::

         growpart may be contained in the **cloud-utils-growpart/cloud-utils/cloud-initramfs-tools/cloud-init** package. You can run the preceding command directly and then run the **growpart** command to check whether growpart has been installed successfully.

   #. Run the following command to obtain the file system type and UUID:

      **blkid**

      The command output is as follows:

      .. code-block::

         /dev/xvda2: UUID="1a1ce4de-e56a-4e1f-864d-31b7d9dfb547" TYPE="ext4"

   #. Stop the ECS and use it to create a private image.

      .. code-block:: console

         Type `helpÂ´ to learn how to use Xshell prompt.

   #. Use the created image to create an ECS with a 50 GB system disk. Log in to the ECS and run the following command to query the expanded partitions:

      **parted -l /dev/xvda**

      As shown in the command output, the root partition has been expanded automatically.
