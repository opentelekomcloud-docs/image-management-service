What Do I Do If I Chose the Wrong OS or System Disk Capacity When Registering a Private Image?
==============================================================================================

If you selected the wrong OS, the ECS creation may fail when the image is used.

If the system disk capacity you configured is less than the one in the image file, image registration will fail.

In such cases, delete the image and create a new one using the correct settings.
