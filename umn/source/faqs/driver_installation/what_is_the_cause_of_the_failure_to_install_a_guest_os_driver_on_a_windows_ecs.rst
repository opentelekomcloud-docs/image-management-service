What Is the Cause of the Failure to Install a Guest OS Driver on a Windows ECS?
===============================================================================

Possible causes:

-  Your image file was exported from a VMware VM, and VMware Tools was not uninstalled or not completely uninstalled.

-  You have downloaded the Guest OS driver of an incorrect version for your Windows ECS.
-  The disk space available for installing the Guest OS driver is insufficient. Ensure that the disk where the Guest OS driver is installed has at least 300 MB space available.
