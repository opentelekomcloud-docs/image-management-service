How Do I Install VirtIO Drivers in Windows?
===========================================

The installation only applies to KVM ECSs.

Before using an ECS or external image file to create a private image, ensure that VirtIO drivers have been installed in the OS so that ECSs created from this image can support KVM virtualization and the network performance can be improved.

For details, see :ref:`Installing VirtIO Drivers <en-us_topic_0000001841305273>`.
