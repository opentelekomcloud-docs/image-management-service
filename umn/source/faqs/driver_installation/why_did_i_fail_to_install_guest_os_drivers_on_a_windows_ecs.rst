Why Did I Fail to Install Guest OS Drivers on a Windows ECS?
============================================================

Possible causes:

-  Your image file was exported from a VMware VM, and VMware Tools was not uninstalled or not completely uninstalled.

-  You have downloaded Guest OS drivers of an incorrect version for your Windows ECS.
-  The disk space available for installing Guest OS drivers is insufficient. Ensure that the disk where Guest OS drivers are installed has at least 300 MB space available.
