How Do I Install UVP VMTools in Windows?
========================================

This only applies to KVM ECSs. Before using an ECS or external image file to create a private image, ensure that UVP VMTools has been installed in the OS to enable subsequently created ECSs to support KVM virtualization and improve network performance.

For details, see :ref:`Installing UVP VMTools <en-us_topic_0037352061>`.
