Must I Install Guest OS Drivers on an ECS?
==========================================

Installing Guest OS drivers on an ECS improves your experience in using the ECS. In addition, it also ensures high reliability and stability of ECSs.

-  Windows ECSs: Install the PV driver and UVP VMTools on ECSs.
-  Linux ECSs: Install xen-pv and VirtIO drivers and load them in initrd.
