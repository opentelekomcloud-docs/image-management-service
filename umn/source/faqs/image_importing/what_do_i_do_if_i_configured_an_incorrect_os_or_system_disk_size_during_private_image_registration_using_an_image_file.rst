What Do I Do If I Configured an Incorrect OS or System Disk Size During Private Image Registration Using an Image File?
=======================================================================================================================

If you selected an incorrect OS, ECSs may fail to be created from the private image. If the configured system disk size is less than the one in the image file, image registration will fail.

In such cases, delete the incorrect image and create a new one using correct parameter settings.
