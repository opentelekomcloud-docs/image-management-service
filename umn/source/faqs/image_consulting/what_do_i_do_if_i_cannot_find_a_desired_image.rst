What Do I Do If I Cannot Find a Desired Image?
==============================================

You can view OS types and versions on the **Public Images** page on the management console. If you cannot find a desired image, you have the following options:

-  Download an image file from the official OS website and then use the file to create a private image. For details, see :ref:`Creating a Windows System Disk Image from an External Image File <en-us_topic_0030713181>` or :ref:`Creating a Linux System Disk Image from an External Image File <en-us_topic_0030713190>`. The external image file can be in VMDK, VHD, QCOW2, RAW, VHDX, QED, VDI, QCOW, ZVHD2, or ZVHD format.
-  If the image belongs to another tenant, ask the tenant to share it with you. For details about image sharing, see :ref:`Sharing Specified Images <en-us_topic_0032042419>`.
