Can I Import Data from a Data Disk Image to a Data Disk?
========================================================

No.

A data disk image can only be used to apply for a new disk and its data cannot be imported to a disk. To import the data, perform the following operations:

#. Use the data disk image to create a temporary disk.
#. Attach the temporary disk to the ECS where the target disk is located.
#. Copy data from the temporary disk to the target disk. Then, delete the temporary disk.
