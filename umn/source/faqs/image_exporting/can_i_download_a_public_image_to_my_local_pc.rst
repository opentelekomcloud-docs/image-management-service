Can I Download a Public Image to My Local PC?
=============================================

Currently, you cannot directly download a public image. You can use the public image to create an ECS, use the ECS to create a private image, export the private image to your OBS bucket, and download the private image to your local PC.

.. note::

   Windows and SUSE Linux public images and the private images created from these public images cannot be exported.
