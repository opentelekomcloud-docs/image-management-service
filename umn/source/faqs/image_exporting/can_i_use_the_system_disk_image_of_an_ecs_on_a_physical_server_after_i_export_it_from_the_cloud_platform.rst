Can I Use the System Disk Image of an ECS on a Physical Server After I Export It from the Cloud Platform?
=========================================================================================================

No. The system disk image of an ECS is a VM file that contains a system running environment and does not have an installation boot program. Therefore, it cannot be used on a physical server.
