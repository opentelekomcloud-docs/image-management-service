Why Is the Image Size in an OBS Bucket Different from That Displayed in IMS?
============================================================================

Symptom
-------

After a private image is exported to an OBS bucket, the image size in the bucket is different from that displayed in IMS. For example, the size of a private image is 1.04 GB on the IMS console. After it is exported to an OBS bucket, the size is displayed as 2.91 GB.

Cause Analysis
--------------

The size of an image in an OBS bucket varies depending on the file's storage format in the bucket.
