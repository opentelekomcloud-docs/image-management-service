What Do I Do If the Export Option Is Unavailable for My Image?
==============================================================

Some images cannot be exported. Therefore, the **Export** option is not provided for them in the **Operation** column. The following images cannot be exported:

-  Public images
-  Full-ECS images
-  Private images created from a Windows or SUSE public image
