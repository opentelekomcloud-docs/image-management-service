Can I Download a Public Image to My Local PC?
=============================================

Telekom provides public images, GPU drivers and other software for sole/exclusive use on the Open Telekom Cloud platform to the customer. Therefore, the customer is particularly prohibited from downloading, copying or storing/using public images, GPU drivers in other environments than the Open Telekom Cloud. The public images, GPU drivers and other software are billed monthly for each server based on usage.

By using the public images and GPU drivers, the customer accepts the license conditions of the respective manufacturer that are in effect during the contract, as a result of which an agreement will enter into force between the customer and the software manufacturer in question.

Some public images can be used to create an ECS and based on that a private Image. You can export this private image to your OBS bucket, and download the private image to your local PC. Please consider the notes below.

.. note::

   -  Windows, SUSE, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and Oracle Linux public images and the private images created from these public images cannot be exported.
   -  However, if a Windows, SUSE, Red Hat, Ubuntu, or Oracle Linux private image is created from an external image file, this private image can be exported.
