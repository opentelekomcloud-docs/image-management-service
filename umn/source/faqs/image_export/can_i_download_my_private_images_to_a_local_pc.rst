Can I Download My Private Images to a Local PC?
===============================================

Yes. You can download private images as instructed in :ref:`Exporting an Image <en-us_topic_0034011241>`.

Currently, only images in VMDK, VHD, QCOW2, or ZVHD format can be exported.

The default format of a private image is ZVHD2. Images exported in different formats may vary in size.
