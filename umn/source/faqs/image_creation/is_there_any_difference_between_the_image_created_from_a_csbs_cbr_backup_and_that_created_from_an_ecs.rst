Is There Any Difference Between the Image Created from a CSBS/CBR Backup and That Created from an ECS?
======================================================================================================

No.

You can create a full-ECS image from an ECS, a CSBS backup, or a CBR backup.

When you create a full-ECS image from an ECS, the system first creates a backup for the ECS and then uses the backup to create an image. Therefore, the image is essentially created from an ECS backup no matter you use an ECS or a CSBS/CBR backup.
