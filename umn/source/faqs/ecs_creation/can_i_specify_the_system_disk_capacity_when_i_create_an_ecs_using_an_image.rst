Can I Specify the System Disk Capacity When I Create an ECS Using an Image?
===========================================================================

Yes, but you cannot create a system disk smaller than the original and the maximum allowed is 30,768 GB.

.. note::

   Ensure that your ECS OS can support the system disk size you specified.
