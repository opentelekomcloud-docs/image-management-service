Can I Specify the System Disk Capacity When I Create an ECS Using an Image?
===========================================================================

Yes. However, the value must be smaller than 30,768 GB but no less than the system disk capacity in the image.

.. note::

   Ensure that your ECS OS supports the system disk capacity you specified.
