Can I Change the Image of a Purchased ECS?
==========================================

Yes.

If you have selected an incorrect image or your service requirements have changed, you can change the image of your ECS.

You can change the image type (public, private, and shared images) and OS. For details, see "Changing the OS" in *Elastic Cloud Server User Guide*.
