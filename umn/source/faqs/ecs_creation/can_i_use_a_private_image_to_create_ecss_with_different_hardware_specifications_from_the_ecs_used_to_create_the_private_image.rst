Can I Use a Private Image to Create ECSs with Different Hardware Specifications from the ECS Used to Create the Private Image?
==============================================================================================================================

Yes. You can specify the CPU, memory, bandwidth, data disks of the new ECSs if necessary. You can also specify their system disk size. The value must be smaller than 1024 GB but no less than the system disk size in the image.
