What Do I Do If I Cannot Share My Images?
=========================================

**Cause 1**: Some images cannot be shared in any cases (the **Share** button in the **Operation** column for these images is unavailable), such as:

-  Encrypted images
-  Full-ECS images created from a CSBS backup

**Cause 2**: Images can only be shared within the same region. If you are attempting to share an image across regions, your attempt will fail.
