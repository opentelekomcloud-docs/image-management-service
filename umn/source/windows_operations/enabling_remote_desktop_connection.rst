Enabling Remote Desktop Connection
==================================

Scenarios
---------

If you want to remotely access an ECS, enable remote desktop connection for the source ECS when creating a private image. This function must be enabled for GPU-accelerated ECSs.

.. note::

   When registering an external image file as a private image, enable remote desktop connection on the VM where the external image file is located. You are advised to enable this function on the VM and then export the image file.

Prerequisites
-------------

You have logged in to the ECS used to create a Windows private image.

For details about how to log in to an ECS, see *Elastic Cloud Server User Guide*.

Procedure
---------

#. Before enabling this function, you are advised to set the resolution of the ECS to 1920Ã—1080.

   On the ECS, choose **Start** > **Control Panel**. Under **Appearance and Personalization**, click **Adjust screen resolution**. Then select a proper value from the **Resolution** drop-down list box.

#. Choose **Start**, right-click **Computer**, and choose **Properties** from the shortcut menu.

#. Click **Remote settings**.

#. In the **Remote** tab, select **Allow connections from computers running any version of Remote Desktop (less secure)**.

#. Click **OK**.
