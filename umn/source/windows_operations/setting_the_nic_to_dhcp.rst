Setting the NIC to DHCP
=======================

Scenarios
---------

If a private image is created from an ECS or external image file and the VM where the ECS or external image file is located is configured with a static IP address, you need to change the NIC attribute to DHCP so that the new ECSs created from the private image can dynamically obtain an IP address.

This section uses Windows Server 2008 R2 as an example to describe how to configure DHCP. For details about how to configure DHCP on ECSs running other OSs, see the relevant OS documentation.

.. note::

   When registering an external image file as a private image, configure DHCP on the VM where the external image file is located. You are advised to configure DHCP on the VM and then export the image file.

Prerequisites
-------------

You have logged in to the ECS used to create a Windows private image.

For details about how to log in to an ECS, see *Elastic Cloud Server User Guide*.

Procedure
---------

#. On the ECS, choose **Start** > **Control Panel**.

#. Click **Network and Internet Connections**.

#. Click **Network and Sharing Center**.
