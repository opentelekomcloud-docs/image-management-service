Optimization Process
====================

A Linux ECS can run properly only when VirtIO drivers have been installed on it and the disk ID in its GRUB configuration file and fstab file has been changed to UUID.

Preparations
------------

#. Use the Linux image to be optimized to create an ECS, and start and log in to the ECS.

#. Check whether the private image needs to be optimized.

   For details, see :ref:`Checking Whether a Private Image Needs to be Optimized <en-us_topic_0037352185>`.
