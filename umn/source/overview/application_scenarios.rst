Application Scenarios
=====================

-  Migrating servers to the cloud or on the cloud

   You can import local images in various formats such as VHD, VMDK, QCOW2, and RAW to the cloud platform and use the images to quickly create cloud servers for service migration to the cloud.

-  Deploying a specific software environment

   Use shared images to quickly build custom software environments without having to manually configure environments or install any software. This is especially useful for Internet startups.

-  Batch deploying software environments

   Prepare an ECS with an OS, the partition arrangement you prefer, and software installed to create a private image. You can use the image to create batch clones of your custom ECS.

-  Backing up server environments

   Create an image from an ECS to back up the ECS. If the ECS breaks down due to software faults, you can use the image to restore the ECS.
